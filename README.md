# Sales Prediction using Linear Regression
Testing out some ML linear regression on some dataset I found.

## Introduction & idea of the project
The idea of this project is to start playing with prediction modules of ML. I found some dataset regarding the amount spend in advertising in every media (TV, Radio, Newspaper). The sales of the product depend on the advertisement cost of the product.

>*QUESTION*

>Are we able to predict the future sales of a product based on the amount spent in the advertisement of the product?

**NOTE:** This project was initially started in Jupyter Notebook but it looks like in the version I was using it was some problem about self SSH and HTTPS certificates and would'nt load the dataframe from Github. Just switched to Google Colab, same thing basically :)
